I would be especially interested in a general definition of the
proposed selection method, so it could be applied in other
contexts. Furthermore, it is claimed that the Grand Prix Selection is
a fitnessless method. I am not quite fond of this term since the
ranking after driving a race can be considered as fitness as well,
e.g. doesn't be successful in playing the game itself define a fitness
function? Even if it is not arbritarily chosen, the environment's
designer or the person who defines the task inherently defined a goal
as well. In the introduction, it is even mentioned that the system
uses a "kind of fitness selection". To better distinguish fitnessless
methods from traditional ones, I would be useful to provide a
definition.
\end{quote}

We have added an explanation of why we call it fitnessless, since it
does not give an invariant and individual score (or fitness) to every
individual, it's simply a way of keeping track the positions in the
podium, and, in that sense, it's simply a way of tallying the result
of a (repeated) tournament selection; the individuals don't have a
fitness {\em before} entering Grand Prix Selection and we give the
result of the tournaments based on that fitness. The selection is what
yields a score that does not really have existence outside the
selection procedure.

We have added this text to the paper in order to clarify what we
understand by fitnessless:
{\em Although this selection uses a score that could be assimilated to a fitness, it's actually an extension of a tournament selection policy since it creates tournaments of several individuals, and ``scores'' them according to how they fare in these races. This is not actually a fitness, since it's not intrinsic to the individual. It's equivalent to, in a $n$-tournament selection that is repeated several times, giving a score of $n$ to the first, $n-1$ to the second, and then using this for selection. That score is, thus, not a fitness but actually a way of keeping track of the position of the individual in the different tournaments it's participated.}

                \begin{quote}
                 According to the authors, simulating solo-races is
                 not a reliable way of evaluating a car
                 controller. Instead, they suggest to use a relative
                 performance measure based on ranks in 10-car races,
                 thus also being able to capture the controller
                 performance in the presence of other cars. I would
                 argue this is not actually a different selection
                 operator, it is just a different fitness function. It
                 was therefore confusing to me why the authors chose
                 to call their approach "fitnessless" - they are still
                 using a score that is compared. I would suggest to
                 either clarify this further or pick different
                 terminology.
               \end{quote}

We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In fact, it can be
considered an alternative fitness function; however, usually methods
that don't use a fitness score that is independent of the selection
procedure are considered fitnessless; we also call it {\em
  fitnessless} as opposed to the fitness function we give to the same
individual in solo races, when that's the method used in some
generations in the paper. Just to clarify, this {\em score} is simply
a writedown of the position of the car in the different races, in the
same way that if we were running repeated tournament selections we
would tally up the number of wins or loses. It's also called
fitnessless because there's no absolute number that can be called that
way, no crisp number that tells you if a car controller is better than
other. We can only compare them (and only partially), and see how they
run in different races; this {\em fitness} (which should be called
more properly a score) is the result of the selection process, not the
other way round, the selection process is the result of the fitness of
the individuals participating in it. This is similar to a
coevolutionary strategy, and has been called traditionally {\em
  fitnessless}, which is what we do here.

As the reviewer suggests, we have added a clarification (and a
reference) in the following paragraph:

{\em Thus, in this paper we are testing the best approaches we have
  found all together in an algorithm, considering a kind of
  fitnessless selection, which we have called \textit{Grand Prix
    Selection} (GPS). Although this selection uses a score that could
  be assimilated to a fitness, it's actually an extension of a
  tournament selection policy since it creates tournaments of several
  individuals, and ``scores'' them according to how they fare in these
  races. This is not actually a fitness, since it's not intrinsic to
  the individual. It's equivalent to, in a $n$-tournament selection
  that is repeated several times, giving a score of $n$ to the first,
  $n-1$ to the second, and then using this for selection. That score
  is, thus, not a fitness but actually a way of keeping track of the
  position of the individual in the different tournaments it's
  participated; since, in this context, we have no way of evaluating (
  = assigning a fitness) to a controller but only a way to compare
  them, we call this approach {\em fitnessless}, as it was called, for
  instance, in {\sc jaskowski2008winning}.}

\item {\bf \underline{ Reviewer 3 Comments}}\\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf It was therefore confusing to me why the authors chose to call their approach "fitnessless" - they are still using a score that is compared. I would suggest to either clarify this further or pick different terminology.}\\
.............................
		\item {\bf	There is just one track that is used for training, and the same track is used for evaluation as well (in addition to one other track)}:\\
		Authors have considered two other tracks: Wheel 2 which is a Suzuka F1 inspired track with more challenging difficulties and Street 1 track for testing purpose.\\
		They are multiplied the races number running the  10 races for each track.
		\item {\bf	About the analysis of the noise section} However, it could have been clearer how many individuals were picked and how often they were evaluated.\\
		Authors selects randomly $20\%$ of the population size (60 individuals)
	
		\item {\bf There were also some statements I was missing some form of evidence for:}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item	"successful racing will only need these sensor values" (2)\\
.............................
			\item	the approach could generalise to other types of controllers (6)\\
.............................
			\item	reduced diversity is good (1) -> usually, the opposite is true in my experience\\
.............................
			\end{itemize}

		\item {\bf 	While the paper is generally well-structured, there are several problems with the writing, sometimes making the message unclear. Examples are:}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item "A fitness is substituted by a podium"\\
.............................
			\item "use neuroevolution instead of evolving" -> both are evolutionary approaches?\\
.............................
			\item What does "map the trajectory" mean?\\
.............................
			\item It is not clear whether the statistics about the articles cited are about TORCS or not? And if they aren't, why are they relevant?\\
.............................
			\item "the higher diversification factor which it means"\\
.............................
			\end{itemize}
	

	\item {\bf Minor language comments: :} 
				\begin{itemize}
				\item 	"driving a car is a problem" -> It is not clear at this point that you are talking about an optimisation problem\\
.............................
				\item 	"eventually some of them are decided" -> Eventually makes it sound like there is a sequence of events here?\\
.............................
	

				\item 	"in this environment is quite hard" -> very vague\\
.............................

				\item 	"on the other hand" should only be used in conjunction with "on the one hand"\\
.............................
				\item 	"previsely"?\\
.............................
