  \begin{abstract}
    Evolution is a powerful problem-solving technique, and it has been
extensively used for designing racing car controllers. It present a
series of challenges: it needs an evaluation function that is able to
separate the best controllers from the rest, and it needs a series of
operators that are able to explore many different possibilities in the
controller search space. But racing scores are variable and also
depend on adversaries and the actual track, and this uncertainty also
means that it is much more important to maintain a high
diversity. Building on the experience drawn from our previous work, in
this paper we evaluate a kind of fitnessless selection based on
competition and called Grand Prix Selection (GPS), which should be
able to reduce uncertainty by using something more realistic than solo
race scores to select individuals; however, uncertainty has the
unintended side effect of increasing diversity, so we will evaluate
the diversity-increasing BLX-$alpha$ operator in combination with
them, and see its effects on overall performance. In general, results
will show that these combined improvements establish a new level of
performance of evolved controllers, being able to beat, both standard
and previously evolved controllers, as well as a high-ranked
controller of TORCS competitions.

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}

% Antonio - Is somebody writing this? I guess it is incomplete 
% (something is missing before)... :_D
% Are you? - JJ

In a simulated and
    realistic racing car environment, however, racing car scores are a
    statistical variable whose value will vary depending on track and
    (simulated) atmospheric conditions; and we should never forget
    that score in a training track will always be a surrogate of its
    actual score when racing against other cars in different tracks,
    which adds another layer of uncertainty.


% The two new techniques introduced in this paper, namely, \textit{Grand Prix selection} (GPS) and $BLX-\alpha$ crossover, try to improve on previous results by first relying less on the surrogacy of the fitness function
% to select the best individuals. The GPS will use a parameter-less fitness function to select a few individuals that will race against each other; racing will {\em smooth out} randomness in the fitness by putting them in a
% more real environment; racing cars against each other will offer a
% result that varies much less than simply comparing fitness. But, even
% so, uncertainty is present in the fitness and we should avoid
% excessive exploitation of the results. The $BLX-\alpha$ crossover we
% have introduced takes care of this aspect.


The algorithm proposed in this paper overcomes most of the problems we
have found in this line of research, that started with
\cite{DBLP:conf/evoW/SalemMMG17}, which was a basic system that
introduced fuzzy controllers for driving the car and continued with
\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-77538-8_24}, where the shape and values of the
fuzzy controllers were improved using an evolutionary algorithm; that
algorithm was improved in \cite{DBLP:conf/ipmu/SalemMGG18}. However,
we still had to deal with uncertainty, as well as a not so good
exploration of the parameter space; the issue that we were using a
surrogate of the real bot capacity by doing solo races was tackled by
trying to use different fitness functions, but also by racing the best
individuals in the last generation, which we introduced in
\cite{salem_cig2018}. Introducing races in the selection of the
``winner'', even if it was in the last generation, improved results,
so this kind of competitive selection was extended by introducing real
races from every few generations in 
\cite{DBLP:conf/cig/SalemMG19} we introduced the BLX-$alpha$. The
results were the best obtained so far, so in this paper we are testing
a kind of fitnessless selection, which we have called \textit{Grand Prix}, combined with others or by itself, as the only way for car controllers to be
selected for the next generation.

% TODO - *** Explain the noise/uncertainty problem, which is one of the issues we have addressed in the paper ***

%The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next we present the
%state of the art, to be followed by a description of the TORCS
%simulator \ref{sec:torcs}, the defined fuzzy controllers \ref{sec:subcontrollers} and a deep explanation of the Genetic Algorithm implemented and tested in this work in Section \ref{sec:GA_optimization}. 
%After it, the experiments conducted and the obtained results are described in Section \ref{sec:results}. Finally, conclusions and future lines of work will be presented in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  STATE OF THE ART  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{State of the Art}
\label{sec:soa}


% We have to focus the state of the art in three different things
% 1. First and foremost, uncertainty in evolution, since it's in the
% title of the paper.
% 2. Second, alternative selection operators used in games, similar to
% the Grand Prix selection.
% 3. State of the art in TORCS since our last paper (CoG 2019)

% \cite{loiacono2010learning} cites for the first time reinforcement
% learning. Still one of the most popular methods, like
% \cite{giani2019desing,remondaformula,waghdistributed}; in the last
% case, the method is called asynchronous advantage actor-critic
% reinforcement algorithm.

% \cite{vrajitoru2019trajectory,vrajitorugenetic} maps the trajectory using the first lap and then optimizes it using an evolutionary algorithm.
% \cite{mirus2019short} uses neuromorphic architecture, namely,
% spiking neural networks. Choses one training, one validation track
% only. Tracks "that show similar characteristics in road width and
% occurring curvatures." Uses CGTrack 2 for training

% \cite{8833873} uses CG Track 2 and "deep learning", working with
% real images instead of sensors.

% \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0213193} uses neuroevolution, and also
% CG-TRACK1

% \cite{Kole-ParamCarTunning12} mentions CG-Track 2 is "relatively
% harder", with E-Track 3 the hardest,
% \cite{verma2018programmatically} uses CG-Track 2 as a test track for
% transfer learning.

% \cite{Kaushik_2018_ECCV_Workshops} describes a DDPG (deep
% deterministic policy gradient) that uses images to learn behaviors
% for specific racing scenarios.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TORCS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The TORCS racing simulator continues to be one of the main platforms
for testing different autonomous driving or bot creation strategies,
which are, by and themselves, also a hot topic in the gaming arena as
well as by itself, at least since DARPA created their autonomous car
challenge \cite{badue2019selfdriving};
only in the last year (2019) there are around 200 articles that
mention it; during  \cite{schiavullo2019torcs} of its
applications for the last 20 years; they are but one of the possible
platforms that are used for this kind of problem; a good review
(focused on reinforcement learning) was made by
\cite{abuzekry2comparative}. Fuzzy controllers are mentioned in around
15\% of them, while around 30\% mention evolutionary algorithms; very
few, however, around 7\%, use both, and most of them are not actually
using TORCS.

There are several possible approaches to autonomous driving and its
solution using TORCS: you can use vision to have more complete,
although more complicated, view of where the car is and where it's
going, or just use sensors, which only check the most immediate
scenario, but on the other hand are more precise and easy to check; in
our case, we have opted for the latter, although other papers like the,
ones authored by Zhu et al. \cite{zhu2018driving,zhu2019vision,neurone} rather
use vision, using TORCS as a testbed for a different kind of algorithms.


% Fitnessless coevolution: playing games to select, defined in
% \cite{Jaskowski:2008:FC:1389095.1389161}. This is a precedent to our
% "grand prix" selection. That article cites
% \cite{Angeline:1993:CEE:645513.657590} as the first reference,
% calling it "competitive fitness environment", and later developed in
% \cite{rosin1995methods}, but it's been also used in GP by Tettamanzi
% in \cite{tettamanzi1996genetic}. First time used in
% games in \cite{luke1998genetic}, but later used extensively, like
% \cite{Jaśkowski2008,10.1007/978-3-540-78671-9_2,alhejali2011using}. As recently as 2017, an ELO-based ranking
% strategy was introduced for selecting winning bots in a fighting
% game \cite{7792145}. The first one mentions "imperfect information"
% as one of the factors to use this fitnessless strategy.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  METHODS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Methods and tools}
\label{sec:methods}

This section presents the environment where the study has been conducted, i.e. the simulator named TORCS, as well as the fuzzy sub-controllers designed in previous works and which will be the `target' of the optimization process conducted in this paper. 

%-------------------------------  TORCS ----------------------------
%
\subsection{Simulation environment}

\begin{figure}[!ht] 
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{fig/torcs-sensors}
		\caption {TORCS capture showing some of the sensors
                used by the autonomous drivers (controllers). Figure from \cite{DBLP:conf/cig/SalemMG19}.}
		\label{fig:torcs-sensors}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

As many other studies in the area of autonomous driving or simulated
racing car evolution, we are using The Open Racing Car Simulator
(TORCS) \cite{torcs4}, which is free software, and offers realistic
physics, as well as telemetry that is used by the car controllers to
gauge their position with respect to the track, the position of the
rest of the players, and self-measurements like speed, damage incurred
or angle; these measurements are connected to car sensors \cite{manualTORCS}, which are represented in Figure \ref{fig:torcs-sensors}; TORCS provides
these sensor values as input to the car controller and these will be
used to manage the car by means of actuators such as brake,
accelerator, steering wheel or gearbox. 

%All these sensors refer to different angles. The sensors considered in this work are:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Sensor 9 (frontal distance): straight distance to the track border (or another vehicle) in an angle of 0\textdegree.
%	\item Sensor 8 and Sensor 10: distance to the track border (or another vehicle) in an angle of +5\textdegree and -5\textdegree with respect Sensor 9.
%	\item Sensor 7 and Sensor 11: distance to track border (or another vehicle) in an angle of +10\textdegree and -10\textdegree with respect to Sensor 9.
%\end{itemize}

Other open source simulators, mentioned in \cite{Loiacono:2012:LEA:2212908.2212953}, are also available: VDrift
if more focused in 3D realism, and Speed Dreams is actually a fork of
TORCS, same as Gym-TORCS \cite{yoshida2016gym}, which is a Python
wrapper which is specially designed to test controllers based on
reinforcement learning.

Although our results are not TORCS specific, we have been
working on this since it has got all the telemetry and simulation
tools that we need, and besides it has been repeatedly used in
competitions, so it is a good testbed to evaluate the performance of new controllers, in case the competitions came back.
% Antonio - The competitions are over since 2014 or 2015.
% OK, I've added a phrase at the end.

TORCS does not impose a specific way for programming the controllers;
it can be done via any system that maps inputs to outputs. We decided
to use fuzzy sub-controllers, which will be described next.

%---------------------------  FUZZY SUB-CONTROLLERS ----------------------------

\subsection{Fuzzy sub-controllers}
\label{subsec:fuzzy-controllers}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \label{fig:ga}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{fig/flowchart}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Schema of the two controllers that will be evolved by the proposed 
    evolutionary algorithm (GA), and evaluated by TORCS, which will
    return the values for the car's average speed on the complete race and the incurred damage on the vehicle. Figure taken from \cite{salem_evo18}.}
\end{figure}
%
The two fuzzy sub-controllers we evolve take care of target speed and steering angle. These controllers were introduced by the authors in a previous paper \cite{DBLP:conf/evoW/SalemMMG17}, and share the same structure as the standard TORCS driver but they consider five different sensors (see Figure \ref{fig:torcs-sensors}). These controllers are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ga}. 


The \textit{speed controller} takes as input sensor values, and
outputs the target speed; aiming to maximize it straight parts and curves of the circuit. The \textit{steering controller} uses the same sensor values to output the optimal steering angle in order to reach the desired target position with the car.

As aforementioned the sub-controllers use three linguistic variables as inputs, derived from the sensors: one from Frontal named \texttt{FRONT}, one from Sensors 8 and 10 ($\pm 5$\textdegree) named \texttt{MAX5}, and one from Sensors 7 and 11 ($\pm 10$\textdegree) named \texttt{MAX10}. These variables compose a Mamdani-based fuzzy system \cite{iancu2012} with three trapezoidal Membership Functions (MF) for each variable.
Then, the controller is defined using a set of fuzzy rules which combine the fuzzy values for these inputs to get an output: target speed or steering angle.

% Antonio - I move this text and tables to the sub-controllers section, since these variables have been defined to be used in the fuzzy rules. Moreover, the variables are introduced for the first time in this section. 
The controller output is not evolved, and is shown in Tables \ref{tab:output:speed} and \ref{tab:output:steer}. This has not been
varied along this line of research, and has been designed following
usual race car driving rules. 


% Antonio - I don't understand the last sentence.
% Please check this - JJ 
% Antonio - Yes, the variables and values, as well as the outputs, have been always the same, we just evolve the MF parameters.

Thus, what will be evolved with the algorithm proposed in Section \ref{sec:ga} is the shape of the whole fuzzy system, which is encoded in 18 real-valued parameters (related to the different membership functions). The low-level details of this part was explained extensively in \cite{DBLP:conf/cig/SalemMG19}. 

As mentioned, these fuzzy sub-controllers proved to be a good platform for the evolution of racing car controllers, and have not essentially changed since our first paper. As a matter of fact, the methods presented in this paper could
be applied to any kind of controller, as long as it can be fully
encoded and evolved using an Evolutionary Algorithm (a GA).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  OPTIMISING WITH GAS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Optimising Sub-controllers with a Genetic Algorithm}
\label{sec:ga}

% Antonio - I think it is more clear if we describe the GA in a separate section, as it is the main contribution of the paper (well, the operators actually, but they would be even more hidden inside a subsection than in a section).

% ------------------- We need to rewrite most of this
% ---------------
% Antonio - I'm going to rewrite this

% -------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{General description}
% You always need to write a description before starting
% subsections. This general description can be it, except we have to
% introduce the other subsections at the end.  
% Antonio - Ok, done.

We have applied a genetic algorithm (GA) \cite{GAs_Goldberg89}, i.e. a type of evolutionary algorithm (EA) \cite{EAs_Back96}, to optimize the parameters of the membership functions of the fuzzy sub-controllers we have been using in this line of research. 

EAs are nature inspired methods that evolve populations of possible (encoded) solutions for a problem following a process of selection of the best,
recombination and mutation, in order to create a new population of
better individuals on average. This is repeated a number of times
(generations) to get to a solution that meets our requirements, or the
budget we have for evaluation of solutions. EAs have been widely
applied to solve a huge amount of optimization problems, including regression and fuzzy systems \cite{hoffmann2001evolutionary}; in this kind of problem the solutions are modelled as a vector of numeric values, as is the
case in this paper. 

We show in Figure \ref{fig:cromosome} how we represent every individual (chromosome) as a vector of 18 values/parameters (genes), 6 per variable. They have been coded using real values, looking for higher precision \cite{elsayed13}. We started to use this encoding in \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-77538-8_24}.

 \begin{figure*}[!ht]	
 	\begin{center}
 		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{fig/chromosome2.png}
 		\caption{GA chromosome description. There are 6 genes
                  (values) per fuzzy variable, modelling the 3
                  different membership functions. The membership
                  functions are trapezoidal, needing only two values
                  for every one.}
 		\label{fig:cromosome}	
 	\end{center}	
 \end{figure*}

Following standard implementations \cite{GAs_Goldberg89}, in the first step of the algorithm \cite{salem_evo17} a population of random individuals is composed by assigning diverse values inside a feasible range ($[0,100]$).

One of the main factors in EAs is the definition of a function able to determine how good every individual is, this is the \textit{Evaluation Function} or \textbf{Fitness Function}, which must assign the highest value to the best individual.

As Figure \ref{fig:ga} shows, the evaluation of every individual (controller indeed) is conducted using TORCS. Thus each controller is placed in the simulator, i.e. its gene values are injected to the parameters of the membership functions of the two fuzzy sub-controllers. Then, it competes in several races to evaluate its performance.
Two different approaches have been considered here: one based on a fitness computation and also a fitnessless implementation (that will be explained in Section \ref{subsec:novel_operators}).

The first method considers the fitness function which was defined in a previous work \cite{salem_cig2018}, because it was the most successful among some others proposed \cite{salem_evo18}. It is described in the next equation:

 \begin{equation} \label{fit_avg}
 	\begin{array}{lll}
 		f_{AVS}= \frac{AVG(Speed)}{Damage+1}
 	\end{array}
 \end{equation}	

Where $AVG(Speed)$ is the average speed of the car along the complete race. This factor represents the overall performance of the controller combining difficult (e.g. curves) and easy (e.g. straight) parts of the tracks. $Damage$ value is taken into account in order to preserve the car integrity, which is required to finish the race.

Following the usual recommendations in the literature \cite{Harik-ParameterLess99}, we have defined a parameterless function, where there are no weights in the terms.
At the same time, this fitness expression is closer to a `human-like' approach, since it considers the same prioritary factors that a human driver would do.

The evaluation of the individuals (controllers) is done driving a car in a 20 laps race on a circuit without opponents inside TORCS. The reason to consider solo-races is to avoid in part the presence of \textit{noise/uncertainty} due to the participation of other controllers \cite{merelo2016statistical} in the races.

In addition, we have considered the same track as in previous works
\cite{salem_cig2018} for this evaluation, because it has a good mixture of 
curves and straight parts, aiming to optimise the controllers for a more general behaviour, able to deal with different configurations in real circuits.

\textbf{non uniform mutation} \cite{mutation1997} has been used as the \textit{mutation operator} in the GA, because it was considered in previous approaches of our controllers. 

In the following section we describe two new operators, designed and implemented aiming to improve the algorithm performance, as well as the final quality of the evolved controllers. These are namely a fitnessless selection policy and an extended real-value crossover operator able to manage the balance between exploration and exploitation during the evolution.

% -------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Novel operators}
\label{subsec:novel_operators}

%This paper proposes the inclusion of two different mechanisms into the algorithm in order to improve its performance, as well as they allow to obtain better controllers overall.

The first operator presented is a \textbf{Grand Prix Selection} policy (GPS), which aims to choose more reliable individuals/controllers as parents to combine their genes for creating new individuals in the following generation of the algorithm.
It is a fitnessless approach, independent of the aforementioned fitness function (see Equation \ref{fit_avg}), designed to better deal with the uncertainty present in the election of an actual good individual.

The mechanism arranges groups of 10 individuals/controllers which are placed in a track in TORCS, where different races are simulated. Thus, they compete, using the same car (i.e. in the same conditions) during several laps. After every race, the controllers get a score according to their position in the final rank. This is a \textit{score function} based in Formula 1 Grand Prix ranking, so the obtained punctuations per rank are: rank 1 - 25 points, 2 - 18, 3 - 15, 4 - 12, 5 - 10, 6 - 8, 7 - 6, 8 - 4, 9 - 2, 10 - 1.
Then, the best individuals will be those whose accumulated score (sum of scores of all races) are the five highest.

The objective of this operator is to really select the best individuals of the population. However, given the existing uncertainty \cite{merelo2016statistical} due to the competition against other non-deterministic controllers, it is not possible to ensure they are doubtlessly the best.

In this respect, the authors argue that this operator will provide better individuals than one based on a `standard' fitness function, regarding their competitiveness and reliability. The reasoning for this is the fact that their score just depends on their ability to win the race against other competent controllers, rather than in the combination of a set of variables which might add `noise' to the valuation of the individuals.

However, the application of this method consumes much higher computation time, so it could be combined with a classical fitness-based selection in some generations. Indeed, in the experiments conducted in Section \ref{sec:results}, we have analysed the impact of the application of different configurations of GPS, considering different frequencies of application during the evolutionary process.

The second operator implemented in our GA is the \textbf{BLX-$\alpha$ Crossover} \cite{blx2008}, which allows to control the balance between exploration and exploitation along the generations.

The Blend crossover operator starts by choosing randomly a number from the interval $[x_i-\alpha(y_i-x_i).. y_i+\alpha(y_i-x_i)]$, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the $i^{th}$ parameter values of the parent solutions $x$,$y$ and $x_i < y_i$. See Figure \ref{fig:blxalpha}.

 % Paragraphs to rewrite - JJ
Thus, this operator is based on the random generation of genes from the associated neighborhood of the genes in the parents. Three generated descendants are different among them and also among them and their parents, leading to a higher exploration factor in the generation of the offspring.
This operator is suitable for real coded genetic algorithms where it has proved to achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation \cite{blx2008}.

$\alpha$ parameter allows to control the exploration of the space of solutions, depending on its value. So, in order to ensure the balance between exploitation and exploration of the search space, $\alpha = 0.5$ could be selected.

In GAs, the search process needs a high exploration rate in the first generations (high diversity) in order to explore multiple parts of the search space. But in the last generations, high exploitation is preferred to ensure the convergence to the optimal solution.

Given this, we have considered two different approaches in the experiments: one taking a constant value for $\alpha$, and another with a variable scheme, in which the value of $\alpha$ is decreased over the generations (getting sequentially more exploitation and less exploration). Thus, its value is obtained as:

 \begin{equation}
 	\label{eqalpha}
 	\alpha =1-\frac{g}{g_{max}}
 \end{equation}

Where $g$ is the current generation and $g_{max}$ is the maximum number of generations. We think that this approach can achieve an effective balance between exploitation and exploration and therefore, better solutions (better controllers) may be obtained.

% TODO: Results with GPS and BLX-Alpha crossover
% TODO: Comparison against the standard controllers in TORCS
% TODO: Comparison against S&PL controller (of all our controllers, if possible)

In this kind of problems, it is essential to select the correct
training track so that bots are able to work in a wide range of
conditions. Usually a single track, out of all the existing TORCS
ones, is selected, since evaluation in a single track takes some time
and using several of them would make evaluation too onerous. For
several papers already \cite{salem_cig2018,DBLP:conf/cig/SalemMG19},
we have been using the \textit{Alpine 2} track (See Figure
\ref{fig:alpine2_track}). This track has several characteristics that
are essential for evaluating a bot: it has got many turns, some of
them with 180 degrees, steep segments, and some very challenging parts
like the entrance of a tunnel at an square angle. All these features makes
it a good testbed for good turning and collision avoidance
strategies, but also a few straight segments which allow the car to
speed ahead, reaching high speeds. This same track has been repeatedly
used for training as well as for testing and has been described as
``technical and complex'' \cite{AG} and ``presenting a challenge even
at low speeds'' \cite{vrajitoru2018global}, for instance in
\cite{cardamone2010applying,CarRacing_Pelta09,zong2017obstacle}; in \cite{AG} it had the third lowest lap time, after Alpine 1 and Olethros, implying it
has got a good balance between hardness and speed. Since we also used
it in our previous papers, it allowed us to compare racing bots that
had been ``trained'' in the same conditions.

	\end{center}	
\end{figure}

As in our others studies, we have used the vehicle \textit{car1-trb1},
which is a well balanced, NASCAR type car \footnote{See description in
  the TORCS racing board web page,
  \url{http://www.berniw.org/trb/cars/car_view.php?viewcarid=5}},
which we have used also in our previous papers, and also by many
winning bots along the history of the TORCS championship
\cite{torcs5} as well as other authors
\cite{auteur2010,li2019reinforcement}. This matches well the selection
of racing track, but being as it is a balanced car, allows driving to
fit itself to the controllers we are developing.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To analyze the influence of the new introduced Grand Prix Selection (GPS) and the crossover operator on the performance of the fuzzy controller, we have carried out  two main optimization processes based on the GPS: the first one uses the GPS with the two point crossover operator while the second uses the varying $BLX-\alpha$. \\
In each process, three configurations are considered, for the first one, GPS is applied in every generation giving the new proposed controllers $GFC-GPSVAE$ and
$GFC-GPSE$. In the second an third configuration, we retrained our previous four  controllers\cite{DBLP:conf/cig/SalemMG19}: {\sf{GFC-GPS5}} and 
{\sf{GFC-GPSVA5}} where GPS selection is used every 5 generation and in the last generation for  {\sf{GFC-GPSL}} and 
{\sf{GFC-GPSVAL}}.
Also  and for comparison purpose, two controllers from previous papers are used, {\sf{GFC-VA}}\cite{DBLP:conf/cig/SalemMG19} and {\sf{GFC-VA}}\cite{salem_cig2018}, they both use the fitness function: $f_{AVS}$ (Equation \ref{fit_avg}).
These controllers are detailed in Table\ref{tab:drivers}. 
We have run the algorithms with a population size of 60
individuals. The rest of parameters are: Generations=50, Crossover
rate=0.85, Mutation rate=0.09, and 10 different runs per
configuration.  We kept the same evolutionary parameters as our previous controllers  to be able to compare them in the same conditions.

\subsection{Uncertainty in fitness evaluation}

We need first to find out how different kind of selection procedures
affect uncertainty in scores. Better selection procedures should be
able to reduce it, making evolved controllers as centrally distributed
as possible; other kind of selections should keep distribution of
scores (for a single controller) skewed and lopsided; this is why we
have done an study of the distribution  of the genetic individuals of
three evolution processes $GFC$, $GFC-GPSE$ and $GFC-VAGPS5$. 


Skewness is related to how symmetric the distribution of fitness
scores is. There are several strategies that deal with this kind of
uncertain (usually called {\em noisy} fitness functions; but a simple
one is to re-evaluate ({\em re-sample}) the score every generation. A
skewed distribution mean that it will more likely to sample a value
that is different from the average, but it might be better or worse
than average; in any case, different from the score we would expect to
achieve in other circumstances. On the other hand, kurtosis measures
the amount of values that are far from the average, creating either a
heavy-tailed or too-lightly-tailed distribution. In the first case, it
will mean that values far from what would be expected are likely to
show up in the fitness score.

This is why we are interested in how these two statistical measures
are going to change with evolution; they will both affect
selectability of an individual, so that, in general, they will select
individuals with lower kurtosis and skewness, since they are more
likely to draw a consistent value and thus go ahead to the next
generation. However, different selection procedures will affect this
in different ways. This is why we have computed skewness and kurtosis for 1 in 5 individuals in the
population chosen randomly, and measured fitness values after the
first, the 20th and the last generation for the three controllers;
results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:gfcsk},\ref{fig:gfcrsesk} and
\ref{fig:gfcvarsesk}). % Which fitness score are we using? - JJ

                  adaptive BLX$\alpha$ crossover.}
		\label{fig:gfcvarsesk}	
	\end{center}	
\end{figure}

All figures show that the evolution process has a certain influence in
these measures, with individuals in the latest stages of evolution
getting closer to the origin, which would be a 0-skewness, 0-kurtosis
Gaussian. However, there are differences between the fitness-based
process ({\sf GFC}) and the other two. In the first case, the
selection procedure simply eliminates the outliers with a high
skewness or kurtosis; there does not seem to be a big change from
generation 30 to 50, so as a matter of fact individuals with a high
and skewed variability are selected as {\em winners} when in fact they
are not.

The two fitnessless methods, {\sf GFC-GPSE} and {\sf GFC-VAGPSE}, are
notably similar, with selection eventually concentrating individuals
close to a Gaussian distribution, although slightly skewed to the
right, and with a positive fat tail. However, {\sf GFC-VAGPSE} is able
to find solutions with lower skewness, always between -0.5 and 1,
although kurtosis is slightly higher for the last generation. Since
this method exploits more found solutions, it seems that it is able to
generate new solutions with a more reliable expected value around the
middle of the area the variable covers, but decreasing more slowly
towards values further away from the center. For the time being,
we can affirm that fitnessless methods tend to evolve individuals
with a score that is less uncertain, and thus more robust and whose
expected results are more reliable.

 In the next subsection we
will see how this kind of selection has an influence in the success as
a method for finding high-performance controllers.


\subsection{Testing Grand Prix selection and BLX-$\alpha$ controllers}


Once the 10 runs have finished, the obtained best controllers from the
previous evolution processes compete again in a similar set of races,
in order to choose the best controller overall per approach, i.e. the
best between $GFC-GPSL$, $GFC-GPSE$ and $GFC-GPS5$; and also between
$GFC-GPSVAL$,$GFC-GPSVAE$ and $GFC-GPSVA5$.

As it could be noticed in the Table \ref{tab:RSresults}, the controller $GFC-VGPSAE$ has win the Grand Prix championship obtaining 98 points from 125 in the track used in the training, it has also ranked first in the track  \textit{E-Track 5}. //
The other GPS based controllers have obtained nearly the same results (149 and 158 respectively).
From Table \ref{tab:RSresults},it is clear that the controller $GFC-VAGPSE$, where GPS selection has been applied in every generation, has won the majority of possible points in the two previous tracks even the unknown \textit{E-Track 5}  track.

These results come to confirm the influence of the proposed selection policy where the controllers obtained from applying the GPS selection alone have won the competition.
 
This results is evident when comparing the points obtained by GPS controllers and GFC.
Indeed, we have made the selection process  realistic by eliminating
the classical fitness function based on the speed and damage average
and replacing it by points obtained in direct races. 
Better speed in solo racing is not a criterion of a good controller, the
best is the one who wins races. The new selection policy allows you to
select the winners on the field and not the possible winners. 
The following experimentation is dedicated to detect the impact of the $BLX-\alpha$.
The best controllers obtained from the two main optimization
processes: $GFC-VAGPSE$ and $GFC-GPSE$ are evaluated in formula like
championship against the references five TORCS bots and the $GFC-VA$\cite{DBLP:conf/cig/SalemMG19}

The above competition clearly demonstrates the superiority of the $GFC-VAGPSE$ controller where it clearly leads in the points. It collected most of the points in the two tracks, leaving the $GFC-GPSE$ controller far behind it. The reference conductors, namely $GFC-VA$ and $GFC$  are classified 3rd and 5th.
The introduction of the $BLX-\alpha$ operator allows the parameters of the controllers to be refined and  increases diversification in the optimization process, which has led to better results than those of $GFC-GPSE$.

To evaluate the cost of the proposed controllers, the table \ref{tab:time} shows the average number of laps % Isn't this

they are ranked 1st and 2nd but they are very expensive in runtime
where they have performed around 2490 laps in Alpine 2, which is a
huge learning time. % Don't all individuals use the same amount of
                    % laps to race? - JJ
The proposed selection policy is effective but in return it requires a
lot of time. 

Another point that we can highlight is that the controllers with
$BLX-\alpha$ have reach the optimal solution in few generations
(between the 10th and the 20th) while the other methods required more
generations.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work} 
\label{sec:conclusions}

% >>>>>> TODO: Rewrite this section -> All  <<<<<<<<<<


% In this paper we have tried to get winning racing car controllers by
% first improving the selection process so that, from time to time,
% uncertainty is eliminated by using actual competitions instead of
% fitness-based evolution, and second, keep the balance between
% exploration and exploitation high, and also variable, by using a fixed
% and adaptive version of the BLX-$\alpha$ operator.

% The fuzzy genetic controller is subject to uncertainties in the track especially in case of presence of rivals so in order to overcome this problem and thus design a robust and reliable bot, we proposed to apply a \textit{Grand Prix Selection policy} where the selection of parents in the evolutionary process is carried out according to the results of a set of mini-championships organized among the individuals of the population, which looks like a car racing tournament selection.
% At the same time, and aiming to intensify the exploration process in the search space, we used the $BLX-\alpha$ crossover operator with decreasing values of the $\alpha$ parameter throughout the generations.

% The evaluation was performed by comparing the proposed controller with bots of the TORCS platform, yielding very good results.
% The other evaluation of our controller was a confrontation with a real bot ($PSRI$ controller), which participated in several Simulated Car Racing Competitions. In this case, the BLX operator and the new selection policy have had a lot of impact in helping our controller to win three quarters of the races by getting the lowest damage, average speed and maximum speed values.

% These results let us to think that our controller could have reached a very good rank in the Simulated Car Racing Competition, which is unfortunately over since 2013. Anyway, we think that the findings of this study (and previous ones) could be applied successfully to other car racing simulators, such as those used in current eSports Competitions, such as iRace (https://www.iracing.com/).

% As future lines of work, this controller can be improved in some ways:
% We can extend the selection policy to all generations while overcoming the computation time drawback by means of a parallel implementation.
% We can also explore other parameter-less fitness functions to evaluate individuals including other factors affecting the performance of the car.
% Another perspective is to use multiple tracks (instead of just one) in the selection process in order to train a more general controller, able to deal with many different situations.
